                <br>
                <p>
                    Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player
                    simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The type of game originated in
                    China and spread with increased contact with East Asia, while developing different variants in signs
                    over time. One of the variants that have become very popular in the last years is the one created by
                    Sam Kass and Karen Bryle (add web ref: http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html) and popularised
                    by Sheldon Cooper from the well known series of the Big Bang Theory. Enjoy the game!
